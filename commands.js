  "Sreeroop's had the pleasure of diving into various projects across different Research and Development departments at both Rohde & Schwarz, Singapore and Rohde & Schwarz, Munich.",
  "When it comes to building things Sreeroop is comfortable with Java, Python, C#, C++, C, Dart, TypeScript, SQL, and GO.",
  "Sreeroop's time at R&S gave him opportunities to tackle ETL Pipelines and Big Data Projects using a combination of Python with Dagster for the ETL process, C# as Backend, and PostgresSQL as the database.",
  "Docker and Kubernetes were used for containerization and orchestration of the services. He has also worked on a few projects using GO for building microservices.",
  "Another interesting project that Sreeroop worked on was the firmware development of a RF device(STM32 based) used in R&S during EMC testing. Sreeroop used C, RTOS, and Python for the development of the firmware and the test automation.",
  "For crafting web applications, you'll often find Sreeroop reaching for the trusty framework like React, Angular for frontend and Node.js or Spring Boot or .NET Core for Backend.",
  "Flutter is Sreeroop's go-to for building mobile applications for both Android and iOS due to its State Management and UI capabilities, and it is is a great way to build cross-platform applications.",

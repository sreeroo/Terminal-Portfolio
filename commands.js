    "I've had the pleasure of diving into various projects across different Research and Development departments at both Rohde & Schwarz, Singapore and Rohde & Schwarz, Munich.",
    "When it comes to building things I am comfortable with Java, Python, C#, C++, C, Dart, TypeScript, SQL, and GO. I feel that HTML, CSS need not be mentioned as ChatGPT/Gemini can do it better than me.ðŸ˜‚",
    "My time at R&S gave me opportunities to tackle ETL Pipelines and Big Data Projects using a combination of Python with Dagster for the ETL process, C# as Backend, and PostgresSQL as database.",
    "Docker and Kubernetes were used for containerization and orchestration of the services. I have also worked on a few projects using GO for building microservices.",
    "One interesting project that I worked on was the firmware development of a RF device(STM32 based) used in R&S during EMC testing. I used C, RTOS, and Python for the development of the firmware and the test automation.",
    "For crafting web applications, you'll often find me reaching for the trusty framework like React, Angular for frontend and Node.js or Spring Boot or .NET Core for Backend.",
    "Flutter is my go-to for building mobile applications for both Android and iOS due to its State Management and UI capabilities, and it is is a great way to build cross-platform applications.",
